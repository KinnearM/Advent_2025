# Welcome to my repository of my solutions to Advent of Code 2025!

## Intro and Motivations
This is not intended as a showcase of my coding skills but more as a log of my learning as I try to improve my coding.

The goal I have set for myself is to solve these all (as far as I can) without any imports, leetcode style.
I just want make sure I have a really good handle of the basics of Python and its limitations so that I may truly understand the need for more advanced tools. 
My plan is to remove the "no imports" restriction for next year's Advent of Code but this is my first year so it's possible that the later problems are unsolvable wihout imports.

My main objectives for this project are to unlearn the bad habits I picked up from scientific coding - no more numpy! 
I wish to explore what is actually happening under the hood with Python, in particular how different data structures are stored and accessed, so that I may improve my code efficiency.
