# Welcome to my repository of solutions to Advent of Code 2025!

## Intro and Motivations

This is not intended as a showcase of my Python skills but more as a log of my learning as I try to improve my coding.

The goal I have set for myself is to solve these all (as far as I can) without any imports, leetcode style.
I just want make sure I have a really good handle on the basics of Python and its limitations so that I may truly understand the need for more advanced tools. 
My plan is to remove the "no imports" restriction for next year's Advent of Code to build on what I have learnt this year.

My main objectives for this project are to unlearn the bad habits I picked up from scientific coding -- no more numpy! 
I wish to explore what is actually happening under the hood with Python, in particular how different data structures are stored and accessed, so that I may improve my code efficiency.

## Contents

**The Code:** There is `.py` file corresponding to each day of the challenge. Each script is standalone and expects an input.txt file in the same directory. I didn't include my input data.

**Daily Log:** A markdown file  (`JOURNAL.md`) where I will log my thoughts and progress as I work on each problem. 
Hopefully this helps me track my objectives and provides some insight into my problem-solving process for future reflection.
